# pyfind
Python source-code search command-line tool

## Installation

Pyfind uses the [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) CLI library. To install for development use, clone this repo and then type this command in the repo folder:

```pip install --editable .```

That creates the *pyfind* alias to run the program, and changes to pyfind.py are immediately "live" &mdash; no need to re-install.

After it's installed, you can use the *pyfind* command to run it. For example, to display the help screen:
